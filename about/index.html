        <ul>
            <li>I currently work as a Data Scientist at Opplus (BBVA Bank Group).
                BsC in Economics, Masters in Big Data and AI, and actually doing another BsC in Software Engineering.
                
                I really love learning maths, statistics, game theory, and everything related to computer science,
                but my main interest and time goes to the fields of Machine Learning and Neural Networks.

                This blog serves as a way of showing my work. Feel free to <a href="project1/index.html"></a>contact with me</a>.
